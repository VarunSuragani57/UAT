Thank you for your recent purchase. Unfortunately, once an order is placed through our system, we are unable to make changes to it or cancel it. However, we are more than happy to contact UPS to see if we are able to intercept your package. If that is something that you are interested in please feel free to contact our Customer Service Department Monday-Friday between the hours of 8am-9pm EST at 1-800-833-3118 and any representative would be more than happy to assist you.
