    <textOnly>Thank you for your reply. We would like to apologize for the problem that you have experienced with your garment. We are more than happy to send a replacement slider to you, please allow 1-2 weeks to receive it.


Below we have included instructions for replacing the slider.


Instructions:


• Take the stop off of the top of the zipper with a pair of side cutters (apply just enough pressure to open the stop for it to come off and reuse the stop).


• Take a pair of needle nose pliers and hold the zipper tape up to slide the slider on.




We hope you find this information helpful. If there is anything else that we may assist you with please feel free to contact our Customer Service Department at 1-800-833-3118 Monday-Friday 8am-9pm EST.
