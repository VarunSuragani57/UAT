The Carhartt team is focused on improving our position on these items so that you will be able to continue to work with us as we build this Industrial business together. At this time, we are working to establish revised inventory levels and availability dates for these particular styles. Please be assured that your Sales Representative will continue to provide you updates on our progress and plans. Until then, these items will have limited distribution.


We apologize for this inconvenience and thank you for continuing to support the Carhartt brand.



Our best,
