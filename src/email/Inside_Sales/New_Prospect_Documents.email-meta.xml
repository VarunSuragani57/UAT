    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

Per our conversation this morning, I have attached the prospect form and credit application to this email.  Please fill those out at your convenience and return to me along w/ a copy of your sales tax certificate and 2 pictures of your store.  I will pass that along to the sales rep and have him or her contact you.  Please let me know if you need any more information or have any other questions.

Thank you for your interest in Carhartt!

Regards,
