    <textOnly>Happy 2016! I trust you are all off to a great start.



Attached you will find our 2016 Industrial catalog along with an attachment showing the styles we will be removing from our Flame Resistant offering this year. There are 4 tabs which will also show you what styles we have come out with to replace those dropped styles.


Please feel free to use the catalog for distribution within your companyâ€™s network.


The items showcased in this catalog reflect our top selling styles Carhartt inventories throughout the year.


Best of luck to you all in 2016 and please don&apos;t hesitate to reach out to me for your clothing/or Carhartt needs!
