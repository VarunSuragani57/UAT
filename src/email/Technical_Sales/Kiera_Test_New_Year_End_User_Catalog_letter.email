Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I trust that you are off to a great New Year and keeping all of those new resolutions!

Attached you will find a PDF copy of our new 2014 Industrial Catalog for your review.  As you will see, Carhartt continues to set the standard as the premium leader for safety compliant and workwear clothing for the working men and women of our country and we continue the 125 year tradition of building the most durable, comfortable and best fitting clothes in the marketplace.  As you will notice we have added many new FR and core styles for your selection which builds on this legacy.  

These newer styles in both flame resistant and the core offering will be available this summer and it would be my pleasure to introduce these new styles for possible inclusion to your uniform clothing programs this new year and going forward.  Please don't hesitate to call or email if you would like me to schedule a visit and/or evaluate a particular style. 

Thank you for the time and your continued support of the Carhartt brand and wishing you a successful new year!
